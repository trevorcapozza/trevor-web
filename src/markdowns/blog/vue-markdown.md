# Adding Markdown to My Personal Site
_Using Vue & Github Markdown_

---
<br />

A few months ago, I rewrote my personal website from scratch using Vue.js which may seem like overkill since Vue is designed for sophisticated single page web apps. However, I wanted to learn Vue and redesign my personal website - so why not do both together? If you want to learn more about that process, check out my [migrating to Vue](/blog/vue-migration) blog.

Before Vue, I was writing static blogs in raw html/css and having to hard code everything together. I knew I had to automate these tedious tasks and I wanted to make the writing process a lot simpler.

As I started researching ways to do this, I came across many powerful tools. I actually got halfway into rewriting my site for a third time using <a href="https://www.gridsome.org" target="_blank">Gridsome</a> because it had great built-in blog features. After running into tons of issues, I came to the realization that I was going to have to do this one myself.
